# Plugin Setup

## World File



## config.yml

There's only one section called `valid-spawn-locations`, which contains a list of all the coordinates where zombies should spawn.

You can configure this on your own

```
valid-spawn-locations:
- ["world", 1.0, 64.0, 1.0] # for world "world" X=1 Y=64 Z=1
```
