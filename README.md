# TheDark

TheDark is a zombie apocalypse survival game where you must survive until the morning.
It draws a lot of inspiration from Hypixel Zombies and Bloons.

## Gameplay

You start with a small amount of money.
Attacking zombies gives you more money to buy better armor and weapons.
However, zombies will get better each round.
Beat round 50 to win!
There's also an endless mode to see how long you can survive after that.

The game supports both solo and co-op.
By default, every player online on the server is added to the game.

- If there are multiple players, players who die will respawn the following round, as long as at least one player survives.
- Money can be shared using `/thedark give <another player> <number of coins>`.
